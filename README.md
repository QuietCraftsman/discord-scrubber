# discord-scrubber
A simple tool for poring over a Discord data dump and removing content.

The reason this tool exists is because there's a lot of content I'd like to have removed, and no longer have access to. Either I'm no longer on the server (guild) or I closed the direct message 5 years ago. This whole project is an experiment to see if the data dump that Discord provides on request can be used to surgically removing content I no longer want to remain public.

It turns out one cannot delete messages from channels that have been archived, or ones that one has no access to. Overall, this was an interesting experiment. Maybe it'll be useful to others. I got what I wanted of it.
