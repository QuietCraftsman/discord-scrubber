# discord-scrubber
A simple tool for poring over a Discord data dump and removing content.

The reason this tool exists is because there's a lot of content I'd like to have removed, and no longer have access to. Either I'm no longer on the server (guild) or I closed the direct message 5 years ago. This whole project is an experiment to see if the data dump that Discord provides on request can be used to surgically removing content I no longer want to remain public.
